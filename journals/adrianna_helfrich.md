## June 8, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- integrating bangerz with posts in front end

Today I created a separate component for bangerz within
posts and integrated it into the post cards. Also touched
up various parts of my front end to make sure everything
is working smoothly.

## June 7, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- comments front end

Today I got the comments front end up and running. It
now displays all the comments for each particular post,
who made them, and you can create a comment by clicking
"comment" on a specific post.

## June 6, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- home page front end
- comments back end

Today I refactored all my comments back end similarly
to the way I did with my post back end. Also got my
delete post working and started on the like functionality.

## June 5, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- post form functionality
- home page back end rework

Today I made sure that my post form was working properly,
then spend the rest of the day refactoring my back end
to get all of the data that I need (not just some of it
like it was doing before.

## June 4, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- home page back end updates
- home page front end functionality

Today I rearranged a few things in the backend for the
posts so that users won't need to fill out every field
(username, date, etc.) when making a post. That data is
now being passed through the backend. I also implemented
the post creation functionality on the front end.

## May 31, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- building out the home page

Today I continued to work on building out the home page.
Been kind of stuck trying to get the token information
so that the user doesn't have to fill out their info
in forms, as well as having the date automatically
register as well.

## May 31, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- building out a design stylesheet
- main page front end

Today I made a stylesheet and mock home page in
Photoshop so that we have a reference for colors and
standards to create a cohesive looking website. I also
finally got started on my main page front end.

## May 30, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- altering posts endpoints for new tables
- comments endpoints

Today I fixed all of my posts endpoints so that they
reflect the changes that we made to the tables last
week. Spent the rest of the day working on and finishing
my comments endpoints.

## May 26, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- altering migrations tables
- minor fixes to back end

Today ended up being a bit of a fixing stuff up kind of
day. We decided as a team that we needed to change our
table setup, and I wrote the new migrations file to
update these changes.

## May 25, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- fully completing posts endpoints
- merging posts endpoints

Today I completely finished the protected posts
endpoints. A little delayed because of some issues with
Docker and merging, but getting started on the home
page front end.

## May 24, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- finished writing post endpoints

Today I was able to get all my "posts" endpoints working.
Stil need to get them protected tomorrow.

## May 23, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Posts endpoints

Today I worked on the endpoints for the main page. Ended up
getting blocked by some Docker issues and a problem with
the migrations file that prevented me from creating a user
(therefore preventing me from being able to test my create
post). Figured that out though and continued working on my
endpoint.

## May 22, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Writing the tables in the migrations file
- Merging that to main
- Got started on posts endpoints

Today I wrote out all the tables in the migrations file and
was able to successfully merge that into main (woo! first
mergr success!). I started working on the endpoint for the
main page/feed as well.

## May 18, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Finished setting up my database
- Trying to figure out backend auth

Today I managed to get my Beekeeper and database stuff set
up. Also we all did a fair amount of researching just to
figure out where to go from here since we are a little
confused on next steps.

## May 17, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Fixing up user stories
- Finalizing endpoints
- Delegating roles
- Setting up database

Today we touched up our user stories and endpoints so that
everything is properly organized for us to start. We also
delegated roles, pretty much just aligning with the categories
that we started with in the beginning. Lastly, we started to
set up our database, and we got Brandon's working with
Beekeeper on his computer. I am still having a little bit
of trouble setting this up.

## May 16, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Setting up the Docker file

Today we all worked as a team to get the Docker yml file set
up (successfully!). All of our Docker setups are working and
connected to Beekeeper.

## May 15, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Perfecting the wireframe and planning overall
- Creating a Mega Checklist

Today was mostly just making sure we have all the planning
completed. We mapped out all of our models and finished
building out our wireframe, as well as correcting a few things
we planned wrong initally. Should be ready to start setting
stuff up and coding soon :) Also made a big checklist of
every single element we need to do for the front and back end.

## May 12, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Writing the issue for the Home page
- Completing the MVP with the group
- Establishing roles and responsibilies with the group

Today we all worked together to complete a couple of checkpoints
for class, including finalizing our MVP and filling out the
Roles and Responsibilty questions. We also all completed the
issues for our sections of the website that we were working on
the endpoints for yesterday.

## May 11, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Organizing and creating endpoints

Today the 4 of us pretty much just spent some time working on
API design. Making sure that we are formatting everything in a
way that makes sense as well as ensuring that we have all the
features in the wireframe that we outlined covered
