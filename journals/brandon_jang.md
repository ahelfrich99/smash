- README documentation
- Project Finalizing

Today, I spent the majority of the day finalizing our project and making our
README for the project. We managed to fix and debug a lot of the errors for each
others code as we were struggling for quite some time on fetch calls and proper
URL linking.

## June 7th - 8th, 2023

- Finalize the Group Post component
- Make a Group Post Comment component
- Make a Group Profile page

I spent a majority of Wednesday working on finalizing the Group post component
while setting up the Group Profile page. It was fun to work with CSS to incorporate
multiple components into the same page. I also got a lot of practice working with
props, and pulling user information from cookies and the token. I got a lot of
assistance from Andrew as we worked together many nights debugging our code.

- Continue on Deployment
- Continue working on Group Post page

I managed to get assistance from Rosheen and she helped me finalize the setup for
the deployments. Thank you Rosheen!! I also continued to work on the Group Post
page as I am having difficulty with the props being passed around, due to the
multitude of them.

## June 5th, 2023

- Work on Deployment

I got started on deploying our site as well as making sure it doesn't break others
deployments. I did run into some trouble deploying, as I had both db and fastapi
deployed, but showing no logs. I will have to inquire Rosheen about this.

## June 1st, 2023

- Work on Group Post Component

I continued to work on the Group Post page, adding a Create function, as well as
adding the components to a main Group Post page.

- Complete Frontend Auth
- Design Frontend for Group Posts

I worked on completing the Frontend Auth so that we can use the token from the
logged in user to update certain components. I also made a list view of the
group posts.

## May 30th, 2023

- Create backend endpoints for Group Posts
- Continue working on Frontend Auth

I created the backend endpoints for Group Posts and implemented the necessary
CRUD features. I confirmed that it works with the FastAPI docs, and started working
on the Frontend Auth once again. I hope to finalize and get it done by today.

## May 26th, 2023

- Design Frontend for Groups

I finished my forms but still unable to create on the frontend. I am thinking
that this has to do with frontend auth but for now I left it as is. I implemented
a modal format for the create button, as well as listing groups as cards on the
main Group page.

## May 25th, 2023

- Continue Frontend Auth
- Start Frontend features for Groups

I continued working on Frontend Auth but was not able to figure out the logic
quite yet. I decided to give it a break and worked on creating the frontend
for Groups.

## May 24th, 2023

- Research and work on Frontend Auth

I spent a good chunk of the day reviewing Frontend Auth and implementing it to
our project. I was not able to fully complete it, but I will try again tomorrow.

## May 23rd, 2023

- Work on getting get user(s) on backend auth
- Delete user function

I wanted to implement a user delete and get user(s) function to add more
functionality for our users. This turned out to be quite a task as I was
debugging for over an hour. I come to find out that it was a comma in my
SQL statemenet. This taught me to understand that SQL have certain structures
and they cannot have wandering, lone commas.

## May 22nd, 2023

- Pull migration tables into my branch
- Work on features for group functionality

The migration tables were completed courtesy of Adrianna, and we were able to
pull it into our own branches. I spent the rest of the day working on the group
features for our project. Our main goal was to get the following functions:

## May 19th, 2023

- Create Group, Delete Group, Update Group
- Get Group, Get Group List

I managed to complete all features by the end of the day and put it in a merge
request for my team members to review.

## May 18th, 2023

 Finish up Beekeeper tables
- Work on backend auth and work to create user and get token

I spent the majority of the day working on backend auth as I had just a small
bit of adjusting to do for the Beekeeper tables. I managed to finish and created
a create account function and get token for auth.

## May 17th, 2023

- Create a sample table through migrations
- Create some data tables on Beekeeper

Today we worked on making a migration into our project
to create a sample table to view. We also made more tables through Beekeeper
for our project.

## May 16th, 2023

- Download Beekeeper and set up
- Create Dockerfile to set up Docker containers

Today, we created a Dockerfile to set up our project. We initially had some
struggle when creating the file, but we managed to pull through and connected
it with Beekeeper. We are looking forward to starting the coding part of the
project.

## May 15th, 2023

- Touching up on the endpoints
- Finalizing the database of choice

We spent the day finalizing the endpoints and deciding on the database we will
be using. We decided to use PostgreSQL. We also figured out that we should be
using one API endpoint and sending DELETE, POST and GET requests to that single
endpoint.

## May 12th, 2023

- Create user stories and upload as issues on Gitlab
- Delegate responsibilites for the team

We spent the day creating user stories for our features and pages. We also
delegated the roles and responsibilites accordingly. After meeting with our cohort
teachers, I realized we may need to come up with more features in case of being
short of work.

## May 11th, 2023

- Working out endpoints
- Create wireframe for the project

We spent the majority of the day working out the API endpoints for our features
and pages. We worked out the wireframe beforehand so it was a smooth transition
into creating endpoints.
